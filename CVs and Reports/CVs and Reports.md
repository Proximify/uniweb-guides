# CVs and Reports
Your academic CV is the cornerstone of your UNIWeb account. You can use your UNIWeb CV to prepare for funding competitions, complete annual reports and create a public profile. Your institution can use your CV data to maintain institutional websites and to calculate metrics and produce annual reports on your faculty’s performance.

The UNIWeb CV offers many benefits. UNIWeb is a web-based application. This means that you can access your CV data at any time, from any web browser. There is nothing to download or install and you will always have access to an up-to-date version of your CV.

An academic CV can become a very lengthy document over the length of a career. The UNIWeb CV is all contained on a single page. This allows you to use your web browser’s Find function to search for specific information. The UNIWeb CV also has various section headers to help you navigate to precise points in the document.

You can either begin composing your CV from scratch, using UNIWeb’s intuitive interface, or you can import your existing data from a variety of sources as outlined below.
