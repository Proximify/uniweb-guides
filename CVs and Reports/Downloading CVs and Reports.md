# Downloading CVs and Reports
Using UNIWeb, you can easily create fully-formatted CV and Report documents using the information in your UNIWeb Curriculum Vitae. While UNIWeb includes generic CV and annual report templates, your institution may offer custom document templates that reflect your department or faculty’s requirements.

Because both Curriculum Vitae and reports draw information from the same source, the process for downloading these documents is the same.

Download Options allow you to adjust the content of the CV or report that you are downloading. Depending on the Document Type selected, some of the Download Options below may not be available for adjustment. 

#### Document Type
The template that will be used to arrange your data into a downloaded document; either a CV or a custom report. Every instance of UNIWeb includes a generic Academic CV Document Type that may have been customized by your institution to fit their branding. However, your institution may also choose to include their own custom report templates. For information specific to your institution’s custom reports, please contact your system administrator.

#### Faculty
Certain Document Types may have different formatting rules and may handle information differently depending on the .

#### Layout Sections
The sections of information that make up the selected Document Type. All sections are selected by default, but you may deselect individual sections to omit them from the downloaded document.

#### Years Back
The extent of time that you would like your downloaded document to include.
Lifetime (default): The downloaded document will include all available information from your account that is relevant to the selected Document Type - past, present, and future.

#### End Date
This option is only visible when a number of years is chosen in the Years Back field, rather than the default Lifetime selection. 
If an End Date is specified, it will be used to determine both the start and end date for the range of years as selected in the Years Back field. 
If an End Date is not specified, UNIWeb will use the date of your download request as the start date for the range of years as selected in the Years Back field, and will include all relevant information dated through the present and into the future in the downloaded document.

#### File Format
The format of the downloaded document. Available choices may differ depending on the Document Type, but may include .pdf, .doc, or .html.

The citation standard that will be used to list publications within the downloaded document. Choices may include APA (6th Edition), Chicago (16th Edition), or MLA (7th Edition).
