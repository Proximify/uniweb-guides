## Exporting CV information from UNIWeb
The process of applying to a funding agency that requires a CCV submission begins by exporting your CV from UNIWeb into an XML file that can be read by the CCV website. 

1. From your UNIWeb Home page, go to **Curriculum Vitae**
2. Choose a **Funding Template** to filter and verify your CV information according to the required sections and fields of your application’s Funding Agency.
3. Select the **Export to CCV** option from the right panel
4. Click **Download CCV XML**. Your CCV XML file will appear in your downloads folder.

## Importing CV information into the CCV website
Once you have downloaded your CCV XML file, you are ready to continue the application process on the CCV website.

##### **Before you begin:** Ensure that you have the CCV website open in only one active tab, as any other open tabs may overwrite your changes with outdated information.

1. Log in to the CCV website.
2. Navigate to **Utilities**, and click **Import XML CCV**. 
3. Click **Choose file** and attach the CCV XML file that you downloaded from UNIWeb.
4. Click the **“I’m not a robot”** Captcha checkbox.
5. Once you have passed the Captcha, click **Parse**.
6. Once the information loads, click **Select all**.
7. Click **Import**.

###### **Note:** Even though the CCV website will warn you that you are overwriting your existing CCV information, only the fields that are contained within the XML file will be overwritten.

Now that you have updated your CCV, you may continue with your application as normal on the CCV website. If the funding agency requires that you only submit information going back a set number of years, see the next section on how UNIWeb can apply ‘Submit’ checkmarks on the CCV website for you. 
---- 
## Applying ‘Submit?’ checkmarks
When you apply for funding, some funding agencies require that you only submit information going back a set number of years. For example, some SSHRC applications require only the last 6 years of publications. 

When the CCV website creates a CV draft for your application, it lists all available CV items that are relevant to the application and selects all available items by default. Normally, you must deselect the Submit? checkbox for each publication that falls outside of the funding agency’s required time period. UNIWeb can automatically deselect all of these items for you.

##### **Before you begin:** Ensure that you are logged out of the CCV website, and close all instances of the CCV website that you have open in other tabs. Any other open tabs may overwrite your changes with outdated information.

1. From your UNIWeb Home page, go to **Curriculum Vitae**.
2. Click **Apply “submit” checkmarks** in the right panel.
3. In the **Apply “submit” checkmarks** dialog box, enter your CCV username and password so that UNIWeb can access your CCV account.
4. Select the **funding template** for your application, and the date at which the checkmarks should start (Oldest and moving forward to the present)
5. Optional: uncheck any sections that you would like UNIWeb to ignore.
6. Click **Apply on CCV**.

After this process, when you log in to the CCV website and access the funding template for your application, the Submit? checkboxes for the listed CV items will be selected according to the time period that you defined in the steps above. You may continue your funding application on the CCV website as normal.
