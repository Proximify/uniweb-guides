# Managing Cross-Appointments

When a new member is created, they are given a primary academic unit affiliation. This, along with their position title, defines their relationship and rank within the institution.

Members can be associated with secondary units as well, called _**cross-appointments**_. Cross-appointments reflect the real-world appointments of that user to faculties and departments outside of their primary unit, while also allowing administrators with the permissions over the secondary unit to access the member’s data, download reports, help the user reset their password, and otherwise treat the cross-appointee as a primary member of that unit.

You can find a UNIWeb member's primary unit at the very top of their profile page, next to their name and title, while their cross appointments are listed lower on their public profile, in the **Current Appointments** section. A single UNIWeb member can have only one primary academic unit, but may have multiple secondary units listed as cross-appointments.

UNIWeb members can add or remove their own cross appointments as necessary through their public profile, but only administrators can change a UNIWeb member's primary academic unit. See our article on [Editing Account Information](../account-management/member-account-information.md#editing-the-account-information-of-other-uniweb-members) to learn how to change a UNIWeb member’s primary academic unit.

* [Add a cross-appointment to another UNIWeb member's account](cross-appointments.md#add-cross-appointments-to-other-uniweb-accounts)
* [Remove cross-appointments from another UNIWeb member's account](cross-appointments.md#remove-other-members-from-a-cross-appointment)

## Add a cross-appointment to your UNIWeb account

1. From your [UNIWeb Home page](../../introduction/feature-overview/navigating-uniweb.md#the-home-page), go to **Profile**.
2. In the centre panel, navigate to the **Current Appointments** section, and click the **Add button** to the right of the section title.
3. Add or edit information in the _Current Appointments_ data entry form as needed.
4. Click **Save.**

## Add cross-appointments to other UNIWeb accounts

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** this procedure requires an [administrator role ](../access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md)within the subject’s academic unit that includes the following [permissions](../access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md#administrator-permissions):

* Edit academic units
* Edit member information

If you have not been assigned a role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task within your academic unit, please contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

Click the name of the unit that is getting the cross-appointee. This opens up a page for editing and making changes to the unit. Look for ‘Cross-appointees”. Click Add.

Administrators make cross appointments by selecting the name of the appointee. Choose the individual you wish to add to your unit. Click Save.

UNIWeb determines the most efficient way to handle the cross-appointment based on the permissions of the administrator. Changing who has access to a user’s account usually requires the confirmation of the user, with one exception. If UNIWeb sees that the administrator has permissions over all the units involved in the cross appointment, UNIWeb determines that the administrator has enough authority to permit the appointment to go through immediately. The user will be listed under ‘Cross appointees’ on the Unit profile page without any involvement on the part of the person being cross-appointed.

The user will see the cross appointment on their profile page. If UNIWeb finds that the administrator’s permissions do not include the unit that the member is a part of, then UNIWeb will have the user being cross appointed confirm the appointment. UNIWeb will send them a notification within their UNIWeb account. The notification will state that ‘X’ administrator wants to appoint the user to ‘Y’ unit. Then the user can confirm or deny the appointment. As soon as they have confirmed the appointment, it will appear on their profile page.

In the case where the user has to confirm the appointment the new cross appointee will be listed on the Unit info page under ‘Cross appointees’ with a Pending tag next to their name, to show that the member has yet to confirm their appointment. UNIWeb will send the user a notification in their UNIWeb account that they have received this appointment. If they deny, the ‘Pending’ tag will switch to Denied. If the member confirms the appointment, the tag will disappear altogether.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** You can see which of members of your unit have cross appointments. Pick a member and hold your mouse over their academic unit. A small pop-up window will appear with the list of all the units that member belongs to.
{% endhint %}

## Remove other members from a cross-appointment

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** this procedure requires an [administrator role ](../access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md)within the subject’s academic unit that includes the following [permissions](../access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md#administrator-permissions):

* Edit academic units
* Edit member information

If you have not been assigned a role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task within your academic unit, please contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

Removing a member from a cross-appointment also takes away the administrative access to their data through that unit. Administrators can remove cross-appointments by selecting the unit, and scrolling to the list of cross appointees. Click the Edit button on the right. Here you will see the same page as for adding members. Click Delete in order to remove the cross-appointment.

Notifications are also used when an admin adds a user as a cross-appointee, in the case where the admin does not have permissions to the unit that they are appointing the user to. The user will be notified in this case to confirm the cross appointment.

The notification will either ask the user to confirm or deny a change \(such as a request for delegation\) or simply make the user aware of a change \(A user removing themselves as a delegate\), which can simply be dismissed when read.
