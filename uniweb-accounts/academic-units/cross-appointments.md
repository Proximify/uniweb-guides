# Managing Cross-Appointments

When a new member is created, they are given a primary academic unit affiliation. This, along with their position title, defines their relationship and rank within the institution.

Members can be associated with secondary units as well, called _**cross-appointments**_. Cross-appointments reflect the real-world appointments of that user to faculties and departments outside of their primary unit, while also allowing administrators with the permissions over the secondary unit to access the member’s data, download reports, help the user reset their password, and otherwise treat the _**cross-appointee**_ as a primary member of that unit.

You can find a UNIWeb member's primary unit at the very top of their profile page, next to their name and title, while their cross appointments are listed lower on their public profile, in the **Current Appointments** section. A single UNIWeb member can have only one primary academic unit, but may have multiple secondary units listed as cross-appointments.

UNIWeb members can add or remove their own cross appointments as necessary through their public profile, but only administrators can change a UNIWeb member's primary academic unit. See our article on [Editing Account Information](../account-management/member-account-information.md#editing-the-account-information-of-other-uniweb-members) to learn how to change a UNIWeb member’s primary academic unit.

## Adding a cross-appointment to your UNIWeb account

1. From your [UNIWeb Home page](../../introduction/feature-overview/navigating-uniweb.md#the-home-page), go to **Profile**.
2. In the centre panel, navigate to the **Current Appointments** section, and click the **Add button** to the right of the section title.
3. Add or edit information in the _Current Appointments_ data entry form as needed.
4. Click **Save.**

## Adding cross-appointees to academic units

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** this procedure requires an [administrator role ](../access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md)**within the academic unit that will receive a new cross-appointee**. The administrator role must include the following [permissions](../access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md#administrator-permissions):

* Edit academic units
* Edit member information

If you have not been assigned a role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task within your academic unit, please contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

1. From your [UNIWeb Administrator](../../introduction/feature-overview/navigating-uniweb.md#the-administration-page) page, go to **Academic Units**. 
2. In the centre panel, locate and click on the academic unit to which you would like to add a member as a cross-appointee.
3. In the _Unit Information_ page, navigate to the **Cross Appointees** section, and click the **Add** button to the right of the section title.
4. In the _Cross Appointees_ page, in the Member drop-down list, locate and click on the UNIWeb member whom you would like to add as a cross-appointee.
5. Click **Save**.

If you have permissions over **both** of the units involved in the cross appointment \(the UNIWeb member's primary unit, and the unit to which you have added them as a cross-appointee\), UNIWeb will permit the appointment immediately.

If your administrator permissions do not extend to the UNIWeb member's primary unit, UNIWeb will send them a notification within their UNIWeb account to confirm or deny the appointment.Tthe new cross appointee will be listed on the Unit info page under ‘Cross appointees’ with a Pending tag next to their name, to show that the member has yet to confirm their appointment. As soon as they have confirmed the appointment, it will appear on their profile page.

## Removing cross-appointees from academic units

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** this procedure requires an [administrator role ](../access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md)within the subject’s academic unit that includes the following [permissions](../access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md#administrator-permissions):

* Edit academic units
* Edit member information

If you have not been assigned a role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task within your academic unit, please contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

Removing a member from a cross-appointment also takes away the administrative access to their data through that unit. Administrators can remove cross-appointments by selecting the unit, and scrolling to the list of cross appointees. Click the Edit button on the right. Here you will see the same page as for adding members. Click Delete in order to remove the cross-appointment.

Notifications are also used when an admin adds a user as a cross-appointee, in the case where the admin does not have permissions to the unit that they are appointing the user to. The user will be notified in this case to confirm the cross appointment.

The notification will either ask the user to confirm or deny a change \(such as a request for delegation\) or simply make the user aware of a change \(A user removing themselves as a delegate\), which can simply be dismissed when read.
