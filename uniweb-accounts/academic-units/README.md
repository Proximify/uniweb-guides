# Academic Units

Academic institutions are organized into various administrative bodies, such as faculties, departments, offices, and programs. Generally, these administrative bodies, or _**academic units**_, exist in a hierarchical structure. For instance, a Faculty of Arts may include departments for humanities, fine arts, and languages. These departments may in turn be composed of various programs**,** for classical studies, music, and English literature, respectively, for example. Each of these institutions, from the faculty level down to the individual program, are academic units.

In UNIWeb, this hierarchy of academic units defines the structure of the network. This hierarchy begins with the institution itself - the top-level academic unit - which breaks down into smaller academic units, and these academic units may themselves break down into smaller academic units. Academic units are categorized by their _**unit type**_, ****the kind of administrative body that they represent.

To help illustrate this hierarchy, UNIWeb may refer to academic units differently depending on their relationship with to other units:

Smaller academic units are nested into a _**parent unit**_. 

Parent units are composed of smaller _**sub-units**_.



Academic units have a **name**, a **unit type** and a **parental unit**. See the following example:

In UNIWeb, this hierarchy of academic units defines the structure of the network, beginning with the institution itself, which breaks down into various academic units and the smaller academic units, called _**sub-units**,_ that are nested within them.

| Unit Name | Unit Type | Parent Unit |
