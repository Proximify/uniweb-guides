# Academic Units

### What is an academic unit?

Academic institutions are organized into various administrative bodies, such as faculties, departments, offices, and programs. Generally, these administrative bodies exist in a hierarchical structure. For instance, a **Faculty** of Arts may include **departments** for humanities, fine arts, and languages. These departments may in turn be composed of various **programs,** for classical studies, music, and English literature, respectively. In UNIWeb, each of these administrative bodies, from the faculty level down to the individual program, is an _**academic unit**_.

### How are academic units reflected in UNIWeb?

In UNIWeb, the hierarchy of academic units defines the overall structure of the network, and **organizes the institution's members and administrators**. Every UNIWeb member account has a primary association with an academic unit, which will affect where other UNIWeb members can find them within the network, especially in search results and in areas like the [Members page](../../introduction/feature-overview/navigating-uniweb.md#the-members-page) and [Research Clusters](../../networking-on-uniweb/research-clusters/), which allow users to filter by academic unit.

Academic units also serve to set boundaries for [UNIWeb administrator access](../access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md). Administrators may only perform administrative tasks, like accessing member data, downloading reports, and helping members reset their passwords, within the academic unit that is assigned to their role, and within the other academic units that are nested below it.

As some UNIWeb users may have appointments or commitments within departments or faculties outside of their primary academic unit, these members can list themselves in secondary academic units through [**cross appointments**](cross-appointments.md), allowing administrators with the permissions over the secondary unit to treat the cross-appointee as a full member of that unit.

Every institution's hierarchy of academic units is unique, and so academic units can be created, edited, and deleted in UNIWeb as necessary to reflect the structure of your institution as it grows.
