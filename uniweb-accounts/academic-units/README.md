# Academic Units

In UNIWeb, academic units exist in a hierarchy and define the structure of the network. This hierarchy begins with the institution and breaks down into the academic units and sub-units. Academic units have a **name**, a **unit type** and a **parental unit**. See the following example:

| Unit Name | Unit Type | Parent Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Visual Arts | Department | Faculty of Arts |
