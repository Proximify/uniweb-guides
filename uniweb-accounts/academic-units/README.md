# Academic Units

Academic institutions are organized into various faculties, departments and other administrative bodies. Generally, these administrative bodies, or _**units**_, exist in a hierarchical structure; for instance, a **Faculty** of Arts may include **departments** for humanities, fine arts, and languages. These departments may in turn be composed of various **programs,** for classical studies, music, and English literature, respectively, for example. 

In UNIWeb, academic units exist in a hierarchy and define the structure of the network. This hierarchy begins with the institution and breaks down into the academic units and sub-units. Academic units have a **name**, a **unit type** and a **parental unit**. See the following example:

| Unit Name | Unit Type | Parent Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Visual Arts | Department | Faculty of Arts |
