# Academic Units

Academic institutions are organized into various administrative bodies, such as faculties, departments, offices, and programs. Generally, these administrative bodies, or _**academic units**_, exist in a hierarchical structure. For instance, a **Faculty** of Arts may include **departments** for humanities, fine arts, and languages. These departments may in turn be composed of various **programs,** for classical studies, music, and English literature, respectively. Each of these administrative bodies, from the faculty level down to the individual program, is an academic unit. 

In UNIWeb, this hierarchy of academic units defines the structure of the network. This hierarchy begins with the institution itself - the top-level academic unit - which breaks down into smaller academic units, and these academic units may themselves break down into smaller academic units. To help illustrate this hierarchy, UNIWeb may refer to academic units differently depending on their relationship with to other units:

Smaller academic units are nested into a _**parent unit**_. 

Parent units are composed of smaller _**sub-units**_.

Regardless of their position in the institution's hierarchy, academic units are categorized by their _**unit type**_ -  faculties, departments, programs, offices, or otherwise.

Accordingly, each academic unit has a **name**, a **unit type** and a **parental unit**. See the following example:

| Unit Name | Unit Type | Parent Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Visual Arts | Department | Faculty of Arts |
| Faculty of Arts | Faculty | UNIWeb University |
| UNIWeb University | University | \[no parent\] |
