# Gestion des administrateurs

Dans UNIWeb, l'accès administrateur peut être attribué, modifié et supprimé en attribuant des rôles aux membres d'UNIWeb. Selon le niveau d'accès dont ils ont besoin, les membres d'UNIWeb peuvent se voir attribuer plusieurs rôles d'administrateur. Si un membre d'UNIWeb a au moins un rôle qui lui est attribué, il est considéré comme un administrateur.

Lorsque votre établissement met en place son réseau, l'équipe Proximify créera vos premiers comptes administrateur. En tant qu'administrateur, il est de votre responsabilité de créer et d'attribuer des rôles aux futurs utilisateurs.

Administrator access in UNIWeb is granted through assigning **administrator roles**. If there are no existing administrator roles that include the permissions that you would like to grant, you can first create a new role or edit an existing role to fit.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** this procedure requires an [administrator role](managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md) within the subject’s academic unit that includes the following [permissions](managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md#administrator-permissions): 

* Assign roles to members

If you have not been assigned a role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task within your academic unit, please contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

You can modify the level of access that a UNIWeb administrator has been granted by adding or removing roles from their administrator profile.

**Tip:** you can also modify a UNIWeb administrator’s level of access by [editing a role](managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md#editing-administrator-roles) that has been assigned to them. This will affect any other members that have been assigned the same role.
{% endhint %}

## ![](../../.gitbook/assets/key%20%281%29.svg) **Supprimer l'accès aux administrateurs**

You can revoke a UNIWeb member’s administrator access by removing all of the roles from their administrator profile. This will only remove their administrative permissions. This will not remove the user from UNIWeb and their CV data and profile will remain untouched.
