# Account Management

UNIWeb can handle account creation and management differently depending on the specific needs of the institution. Some institutions allow visitors to [create accounts for themselves](account-creation.md#creating-your-uniweb-account-from-an-institutions-uniweb-website), pending either approval from existing members, or though automated account verification based on the institution's single-sign-on service. Other institutions keep account creation closed to system administrators, who create accounts and send [invitation emails](account-creation.md#creating-your-uniweb-account-from-an-invitation-email) to new members to complete the account setup process. This process may be automated, so that UNIWeb creates accounts for users automatically.

Once you have access to your UNIWeb account, you can manage your [Account Information](member-account-information.md#editing-your-membership-information) \(such as your contact information, office address, and [password](account-login.md#resetting-your-uniweb-account-password)\) on your own, though a UNIWeb administrator can help you modify this information if need be.
