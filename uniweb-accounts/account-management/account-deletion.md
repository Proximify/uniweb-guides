## Deleting your own UNIWeb account

If you would like to delete your UNIWeb account, you must contact a system administrator to complete the account deletion process on your behalf.

## ![](../../.gitbook/assets/key%20%281%29.svg) Deleting a UNIWeb member’s account

Deleting members from your UNIWeb network will immediately revoke their access to your institution’s UNIWeb network and will permanently delete their account information from the system.

* Delete existing accounts

If you have not been assigned a role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task within your academic unit, please contact your system administrator.
