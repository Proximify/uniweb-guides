## Deleting your own UNIWeb account

If you would like to delete your UNIWeb account, you must contact a system administrator to complete the account deletion process on your behalf.

## Deleting a UNIWeb member’s account

Deleting members from your UNIWeb network will immediately revoke their access to your institution’s UNIWeb network and will permanently delete their account information from the system.
