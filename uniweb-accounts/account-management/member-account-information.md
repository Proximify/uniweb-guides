# Membership Information

Your membership information serves two important purposes in UNIWeb:

* Your membership information is displayed at the top of your public profile, allowing other UNIWeb members to contextualize your position within your institution and contact you using methods that you prefer. 
* Parts of your membership information, like your account type and position title, will affect both your discoverability within UNIWeb and the information fields that are available for you to fill out on your public profile.

#### On this page:

* [Editing your membership information](member-account-information.md#editing-your-member-account-information)
* [Hiding your account email address](member-account-information.md#hiding-your-account-email-address)
* [Editing the membership information of other UNIWeb members](member-account-information.md#editing-the-member-account-information-of-other-UNIWeb-members)
* [Membership information fields](member-account-information.md#account-information-fields)

## Editing your membership information

1. From your [UNIWeb Home page](../../navigating-uniweb.md#the-home-page), go to **Profile**.
2. In the centre panel, to the right of your name, click **Edit**.
3. Add to or edit your account information in the data entry form as needed.
4. Click **Save.**

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note:** As a general UNIWeb member, you can change all of your account information except for your account type, as this field can affect several areas of UNIWeb. If you need to change your account type, contact a system administrator for your academic unit.
{% endhint %}

## Changing your account email address

By default, the email address that was used to create your UNIWeb account is automatically listed within your membership information, and thus on your [public profile](../../networking-on-uniweb/filling-out-your-public-profile.md). If you would prefer, you can change or remove the email address that is publicly listed in your membership information, or you can ****set a private email address to use to log in to your account and receive system email alerts.

### Change your public email address

1. From your [UNIWeb Home page](../../navigating-uniweb.md#the-home-page), go to **Profile**.
2. In the centre panel, to the right of your name, click **Edit**.
3. Change or remove your email address in the Email data entry field.
4. Click **Save.**

### Set a private email address to manage your account

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** if your institution has integrated their UNIWeb network with an existing single sign-on \(SSO\) service, the following procedure will only affect the email address that UNIWeb uses to send you system email alerts. You will continue to log in to your account using your institution's SSO credentials.
{% endhint %}

1. From your [UNIWeb Home page](../../navigating-uniweb.md#the-home-page), go to **Profile**.
2. In the right panel, click **Set private email address.**
3. In the **Set private email address** dialog, enter a new email address. Your current email address will be displayed to the left of the text entry field.
4. Click **Save**.

## Editing the membership information of other UNIWeb members

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** this procedure requires an [administrator role](../access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md) within the subject’s academic unit that includes the following permissions:

* Edit member information

If you have not been assigned a role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task within your academic unit, please contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

1. From your [UNIWeb Administration page](https://app.gitbook.com/@proximify/s/uniweb-docs/~/drafts/-LnYEzOBp5J6ui_Qtfpl/primary/introduction/navigating-uniweb/navigating-uniweb#the-administration-page), go to **Members**.
2. In the centre panel, locate and click on the name of the UNIWeb member whose account information you would like to edit. You will be taken to their profile page.
3. In the centre panel on the UNIWeb member’s profile page, to the right of their name, click **Edit**.
4. Add to or edit their account information in the data entry form as needed.
5. Click **Save**

        <p>Account types broadly categorize the roles of UNIWeb members at their
          institution. Professors will have different needs than students or lecturers,
          and so the account type chosen will affect the sections that are displayed
          on the UNIWeb member&#x2019;s public profile. For example, a professor&#x2019;s
          profile will have a section to list the graduate students that he or she
          supervises, whereas a graduate student&#x2019;s profile will have a section
          to list their supervisor.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The available account types are as follows:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Administrator</li>
          <li>Alumnus</li>

          <li>Industrial Partner</li>

          <li>Professor</li>
          <li>Research Assistant</li>
          <li>Research Associate</li>

        <p>Position titles more specifically categorize roles of UNIWeb members within
          their institutions. A member whose <b>account type</b> is Professor may have
          the <b>position title</b> of Assistant, Associate, or Adjunct Professor,
          for example, though some <b>account types</b> only have one <b>position title</b> available.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This affects certain areas of UNIWeb:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A user&#x2019;s position title will affect the sections that are available
            on their public profile. For example, a professor&#x2019;s profile will
            have a section to list the grad students that he or she supervises, whereas
            a student&#x2019;s profile will have a section to list their supervisor.</li>
          <li>Position titles are used throughout UNIWeb for filtering data. For example,
            narrowing down results in <a href="member-account-information.md">Research Places</a> to
            only display doctoral students.</li>
        </ul>
