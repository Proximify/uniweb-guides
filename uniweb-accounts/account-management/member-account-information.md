# Editing Account Information

Your member account information serves two important purposes in UNIWeb:

* Your member account information is displayed at the top of your public profile, allowing other UNIWeb members to contextualize your position within your institution and contact you using methods that you prefer. 
* Parts of your member account information, like your account type and position title, will affect both your discoverability within UNIWeb and the information fields that are available for you to fill out on your public profile.

**Note:** As a general UNIWeb member, you can change all of your account information except for your account type, as this field can affect several areas of UNIWeb. If you need to change your account type, contact a system administrator for your academic unit.

## Account information fields

#### First Name

The UNIWeb Member’s first name.

#### Middle Name

The UNIWeb Member’s middle name.

#### Last Name

The UNIWeb Member’s last name.

#### Account Type

Account types broadly categorize the roles of UNIWeb members at their institution. Professors will have different needs than students or lecturers, and so the account type chosen will affect the sections that are displayed on the UNIWeb member’s public profile. For example, a professor’s profile will have a section to list the graduate students that he or she supervises, whereas a graduate student’s profile will have a section to list their supervisor.

The available account types are as follows:

* Administrator
* Alumnus
* Doctoral Student
* Industrial Partner 
* Invited Professor 
* Lecturer Librarian 
* Master’s student
* Postdoctoral Fellow
* Professor
* Research Assistant
* Research Associate
* Researcher
* Teaching associate
* Webmaster

#### Position Title

Position titles more specifically categorize roles of UNIWeb members within their institutions. A member whose **account type** is Professor may have the **position title** of Assistant, Associate, or Adjunct Professor, for example, though some **account types** only have one **position title** available.

This affects certain areas of UNIWeb:

* A user’s position title will affect the sections that are available on their public profile. For example, a professor’s profile will have a section to list the grad students that he or she supervises, whereas a student’s profile will have a section to list their supervisor.
* Position titles are used throughout UNIWeb for filtering data. For example, narrowing down results in [Research Places](member-account-information.md) to only display doctoral students.

#### Academic Unit

Academic units designate a UNIWeb member’s academic affiliation to a faculty or department. When creating a user’s account, a primary academic affiliation must be indicated. Administrators can also add members to secondary units, called [cross-appointments](../academic-units/cross-appointments.md), at a later time.

#### Email

The UNIWeb member’s email address.

#### Username

A username that a UNIWeb member can use in lieu of email address when logging in to their UNIWeb account. If a username isn’t filled in when creating a new UNIWeb account, the user’s email is used as their username instead. This cannot be changed later.

#### Telephone

The UNIWeb member’s telephone number.

#### Office

The UNIWeb member’s office address.

#### Homepage

A link to the UNIWeb Member’s primary website outside of UNIWeb.
