## Logging in to your UNIWeb account

1. From your institution’s [UNIWeb Network](../../navigating-uniweb/the-network-page.md) page, click the **Sign in** button on the right side of the navigation bar.
2. In the Sign in drop-down menu, enter your UNIWeb username and password.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** If your UNIWeb instance integrates with your institution’s Single-Sign-On \(SSO\) system for authentication, clicking the Sign in button will redirect you to your institution’s SSO login page to complete the login process. You will be redirected into your UNIWeb account when you have authenticated via your institution’s SSO system.
{% endhint %}

## Changing your UNIWeb account password

If you've forgotten your UNIWeb password and cannot log in, you can send a rescue email to your UNIWeb account email address. If you can log in normally, but would like to [change your password to something new](account-login.md#updating-your-uniweb-account-password), you can do so within your UNIWeb account without having to send a rescue email.
