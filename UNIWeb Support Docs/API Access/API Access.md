# API Access

The UNIWeb API (application program interface) provides a simple way for other software systems to interact with UNIWeb. The objective of the API is to integrate UNIWeb within your existing software in order to eliminate the need to duplicate data, please see the following example.

  Example
Your accounting software could access the API to automatically update its information whenever a researcher receives new funding and enters that data into UNIWeb. Similarly, your faculty website could access the API to automatically update its information whenever a professor adds a new publication and enters that data into UNIWeb.
