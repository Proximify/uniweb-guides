# Research Clusters

Research Clusters are collections of UNIWeb Members, Groups, Resources, Publications, and Web Articles that are grouped together based on their tagged Research Themes. 

When a new Research Theme is created, a corresponding Research Cluster with the same name is created automatically. UNIWeb adds new items to the Research Cluster whenever they are tagged with the corresponding Research Theme.

Finding People with Common Research Interests 
Selecting a person under the Researchers sections allows you to view their Profile and Connections. By selecting their Connections you can view the people with whom they share a common research interest (Figure 8). You can then use the filters on the right to  narrow down their connections by category, academic unit and research interest.
The easiest way to find colleagues with common research interests to yourself is to view your own public connections. These can be found by either selecting the Connections tab at the top of the Home page or by finding your name in the list of researchers and viewing your connections.

Finding People within Specific Research Clusters 
Research clusters span multiple departments and faculties (Figure 7). When viewing a research area, you can see the multidisciplinary nature of its members without being restricted to individual faculties or departments.
You can use UNIWebâ€™s search bar feature to find individuals by name or you can find researchers that share particular interests by exploring the research clusters. Choosing a specific research area allows you to view people who are interested in that research area as well as the sub-themes of that area.
By default, all people belonging to the research cluster being viewed share a common high-level interest or connection. The filters on the right allow you to display individuals and sub-themes that are found in specific academic units.
