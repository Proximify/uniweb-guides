# Academic Metrics

The academic metrics section of UNIWeb is where the raw statistical data from the UNIWeb members' CVs is collected and translated into meaningful information. Data from ten different categories are compiled here, updated automatically as members of the network compose and modify their academic CVs. These categories can be used to monitor the achievements and engagement of an institution or faculty over time or can be exported for formal use in a report:

* Publications
* Artistic Contributions
* Intellectual Properties
* Interviews and Media Relations
* Presentations
* Recognition
* Student Supervision
* Teaching Activities
* Course Development
* Program Development
* Research Funding History

Using preset visualization tools, UNIWeb can help you organize this infromation in the form of bar and line graphs, or lists. These graphing presets can be filtered, but if you need granular control over the information or graphing, UNIWeb offers powerful custom filtering tools to download academic metric informationas raw data in an excel sheet.
