# Finding and Reserving Resources

Resource profiles are listed in Research Clusters, in search results, in the Resources section of the [UNIWeb Home](../../navigating-uniweb.md#the-home-page) page, and on the Map page. Resource profiles work in much the same way as any online marketplace - if you have found a Resource that you would like to inquire about, you can contact the owner via email or by phone to inquire further about using it.

#### On this page:

* [Sending a message to a Resource owner](finding-and-reserving-resources.md#sending-a-message-to-a-resource-owner)
* [Responding to Resource inquiries](finding-and-reserving-resources.md#responding-to-resource-inquiries)

## Sending a message to a Resource owner

1. **Click on the Resource listing** that you would like to inquire about.
2. Respond to the listing using one of the following two contact options in the right panel of the Resource profile: 
   1. In the **About the owner** section, click **\# Click to show** to reveal the owner's listed phone number.
   2. In the **Contact the owner** section, write your email address, your name, and compose a message to the owner outlining your request, and click the **Send email** button.

If you opted to send a written message to the owner, UNIWeb will send an email to the owner containing your message and contact information.

## Responding to Resource Inquiries

If a UNIWeb visitor has sent a message in response to one of your Resource listings, UNIWeb will send the response in the form of an email. The inquirer's email address will be listed in the reply-to field, and so **you can respond by replying directly to the message.**
