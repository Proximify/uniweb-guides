# Resources

As hubs for innovation and learning, research insititutions are home to vast amounts of knowledge, expertise, and specialized research equipment. These resources can be underutilized depending on their level of access or advertisement, or can go unused for vast amounts of time between research sessions. 

Through UNIWeb, you can create profiles for **specialized equipment, consultations services, and expertise,** to make them available to select members within UNIWeb, or to your institution at large. These profiles care called **Resources**. 

Using Resources, UNIWeb visitors can learn more about the services and equipment that are made available throughout a research institution, and can reach out to the Resource's owner directly to inquire about using them.
