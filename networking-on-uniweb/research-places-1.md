# Research Places

Academic institutions seldom operate out of a single location or city. Members of a single institution may operate in various locations across the globe. For the sake of collaboration or for ongoing research, it can be extremely valuable to know which researchers are operating in a certain area, what research has previously been performed in certain areas, or when searching for researchers who have expertise in a specific region.

UNIWeb offers a powerful way to visualize the geographical scope of your institution's reach through research places and the Map page. Using information entered on your public profile, UNIWeb 

On your [profile page](filling-out-your-public-profile.md#filling-out-your-public-profile-manually), there is a section titled Research Places. This section allows you to define a location where you are now, or have in the past conducted a research activity. Once you have added locations to your profile, you will now appear in the ‘Research Places’ section of UNIWeb. To find other researchers, you can search the filter based on name or location, and you can optionally filter by title or academic unit.

When you add or edit a research place, UNIWeb gives you the option to tag it with a research interest. To find your desired interest from your network’s list, you can either scroll through the list or you can begin entering the name in the search field and UNIWeb will refine your results.
