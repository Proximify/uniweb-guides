# Lieux de recherche

Academic institutions seldom operate out of a single location or city. Members of a single institution may operate in various locations across the globe. For the sake of collaboration or for ongoing research, it can be extremely valuable to know which researchers are operating in a certain area, what research has previously been performed in certain areas, or which researchers have expertise in a specific region. UNIWeb offers a powerful way to visualize the geographical scope of your institution's reach through research places and the Map page.

On your [profile page](filling-out-your-public-profile.md#filling-out-your-public-profile-manually), there is a section titled Research Places. This section allows you to define a location where you are currently conducting research or have conducted research in the past. Once you have added locations to your profile, you will now appear in the ‘Research Places’ section of UNIWeb. To find other researchers, you can search the filter based on name or location, and you can optionally filter by title or academic unit.

When you add or edit a research place, UNIWeb gives you the option to tag it with a research interest. To find your desired interest from your network’s list, you can either scroll through the list or you can begin entering the name in the search field and UNIWeb will refine your results.

## Browsing Research Places on the UNIWeb Map

* From your [UNIWeb Network](../navigating-uniweb/the-network-page.md) page, go to **Research Places.**
* The Map page displays Research Places as pins on a world map. Click and drag the map to pan, or scroll to zoom in or out. If there are more than one Research Place listed within a certain area, the Map will mark the pin with a number.
* Hover your cursor over a pin to learn more about the listed Research Place. In the popup window, you can click on the name of the UNIWeb member who listed the Research Place to view their profile, or you can click on the Research Themes listed to view their associate Research Clusters.
