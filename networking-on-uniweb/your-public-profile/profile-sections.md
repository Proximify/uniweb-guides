# Profile Sections

## Profile Sections

Your Public Profile is divided into sections of content which are listed in the left panel for quick navigation. UNIWeb includes the following sections by default, but your institution may have requested the addition of custom sections. For information on sections that are not listed below, please contact your system administrator.

### Membership Information

### Research Themes

### Research Description

### Cross-Appointments

Adding Secondary Units to your account To create a cross-appointment to a secondary unit, go to your profile and click Add next to Current Appointments. Select the academic unit using the drop-down. A title is optional. Additional information describing the appointment or related information is also optional. Click Save. The appointment will appear on your public profile page. Administrators of that academic unit will also have access to your CV information for reports and metrics.

### Affiliations

### Current Teaching

### Office Hours

### Selected Degrees

### Biography

### Research Places

When you add or edit a research place, UNIWeb gives you the option to tag it with a research interest. To find your desired interest from your network’s list, you can either scroll through the list or you can begin entering the name in the search field and UNIWeb will refine your results.

On your profile page, there is a section titled Research Places. This allows you to define a location where you have conducted a research activity. You begin by entering an address. Then, you can add a description, choose a type of research activity and even tag your location with research interests. You can optionally specify a start and end date. Once you have added locations to your profile, you will now appear in the ‘Research Places’ section of UNIWeb. To find other researchers, you can search the filter based on name or location, and you can optionally filter by title or academic unit.

### Selected Publications

To begin, navigate to the Publications page or the Publications section of your CV. Select your desired publication or publications and choose Add Tags from the right-hand menu. You will be presented with a list of research interests that you have already applied elsewhere in UNIWeb. However, you also have the option to add new research interests from your network’s list. To remove a tag, simply select your desired publication or publications and then choose Remove Tags from the right-hand menu and follow the same process.
