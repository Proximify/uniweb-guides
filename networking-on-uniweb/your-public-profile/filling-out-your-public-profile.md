# Filling out your Public Profile

UNIWeb includes intuitive tools to quickly add new information to your Public Profile as needed. Getting started is easy - if you have already populated your Curriculum Vitae manually or by importing information from the CCV website, you can use that information to automatically fill out certain sections of your Public Profile.

## Filling out another UNIWeb member’s Public Profile

> **Before you begin:** this procedure requires an Administrator Role within the subject’s Academic Unit that includes the following permissions:
>
> * Edit Member Information
>
>   If you have not been assigned a Role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task within your Academic Unit, please contact your system administrator.

1. From your UNIWeb Administration page, go to **Members**.
2. Locate the UNIWeb member whose profile you would like to edit, and **click on their name**.

As long as you have been assigned an administrator role within the subject’s academic unit that includes the Edit Member Information permission, you will be taken to an editable version of the UNIWeb member’s public profile. You can edit their profile information manually or import information from their curriculum vitae in the same way that you would do on your own profile.

**Note: this procedure will not give you access to edit the UNIWeb member’s curriculum vitae information directly. If you would like to edit the information in a particular user’s curriculum vitae, see our article on requesting delegate access to another UNIWeb member’s account.**
