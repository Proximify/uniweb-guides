## Filling out another UNIWeb member’s Public Profile

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** this procedure requires an [administrator role](../../uniweb-accounts/access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md) within the subject’s academic unit that includes the following permissions:

* Edit Member Information

If you have not been assigned a role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task within your academic unit, please contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

1. From your [UNIWeb Administration](../../introduction/navigating-uniweb.md#the-administration-page) page, go to **Members**.
2. Locate the UNIWeb member whose profile you would like to edit, and **click on their name**.

As long as you have been assigned an administrator role within the subject’s academic unit that includes the Edit Member Information permission, you will be taken to an editable version of the UNIWeb member’s public profile. You can [edit their profile information manually](filling-out-your-public-profile.md#filling-out-your-public-profile-manually) as you would you own, or [import information from their curriculum vitae](filling-out-your-public-profile.md#filling-out-your-public-profile-automatically-using-your-cv).

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note:** this procedure will not give you access to edit the UNIWeb member’s curriculum vitae information directly. If you would like to edit the information in a particular user’s curriculum vitae, see our article on [requesting delegate access to another UNIWeb member’s account](../../uniweb-accounts/access-control/delegate-access.md#requesting-delegate-access).
{% endhint %}

## Profile Sections

Your profile is divided into sections of content which are listed in the left panel for quick navigation. Certain sections may or may not be present on your profile depending on your [account type and position title](../../uniweb-accounts/account-management/member-account-information.md#account-information-fields) - for instance, if you're a graduate student, your profile will not include a section to list students under your supervision.
