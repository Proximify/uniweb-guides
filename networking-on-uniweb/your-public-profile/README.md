# Your Public Profile

Your profile is your public showcase of your work, interests and your academic career. While your Curriculum Vitae is private to you \(aside from administrators in your academic unit and to any account delegates that you have assigned\), your UNIWeb account also includes a public profile where you can curate items from your CV, display your contact information, list your research interests, link to external resources, and showcase your achievements within your institution.

The content that you choose to display on your public profile is what sets your presence within the UNIWeb network. UNIWeb's innovative networking tools, tied to the information and research themes listed on your profile, help you explore and discover potential collaborators throughout your institution, and help others in turn to discover and connect with you. Accordingly, keeping your own profile up-to-date is key to creating an active presence and meaningful connections on UNIWeb.
