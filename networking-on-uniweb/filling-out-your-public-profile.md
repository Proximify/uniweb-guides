# Your Public Profile

UNIWeb includes intuitive tools to quickly add new information to your Public Profile as needed. Getting started is easy - if you have already [populated your Curriculum Vitae](../your-academic-information/your-uniweb-curriculum-vitae-cv.md), you can use that information to automatically fill out certain sections of your Public Profile.

## Filling out another UNIWeb member’s public profile

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** this procedure requires an [administrator role](../uniweb-accounts/access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md) within the subject’s academic unit that includes the following permissions:

* Edit Member Information

If you have not been assigned a role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task within your academic unit, please contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

1. From your [UNIWeb Administration](../navigating-uniweb/the-administration-page.md) page, go to **Members**.
2. Locate the UNIWeb member whose profile you would like to edit, and **click on their name**.

As long as you have been assigned an administrator role within the subject’s academic unit that includes the Edit Member Information permission, you will be taken to an editable version of the UNIWeb member’s public profile. You can [edit their profile information manually](filling-out-your-public-profile.md#filling-out-your-public-profile-manually) as you would you own, or [import information from their curriculum vitae](filling-out-your-public-profile.md#filling-out-your-public-profile-automatically-using-your-cv).

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note:** this procedure will not give you access to edit the UNIWeb member’s curriculum vitae information directly. If you would like to edit the information in a particular user’s curriculum vitae, see our article on [requesting delegate access to another UNIWeb member’s account](../uniweb-accounts/access-control/delegate-access.md#requesting-delegate-access).
{% endhint %}

## Creating and restoring a backup of your profile

Your profile is your public showcase of your work within your UNIWeb network, and so it is a living document that will grow with you through the course of your career. Because you will be regularly updating your profile, it's important to take regular backups so that you can restore your information in the event that something is accidentally deleted or modified incorrectly.

### Creating a backup of your profile

1. From your [UNIWeb Home page](../navigating-uniweb/the-home-page.md), go to **Profile**.
2. In the right panel, click **Create/restore backups**.
3. In the right panel, click **Download a UNIWeb profile backup**.

A backup of your profile information will be downloaded as a JSON file. 

{% hint style="success" %}
**Best practice:** it's always best to keep more than one copy of a backup, in multiple places that you trust to hold your information securely - a personal or work computer, cloud service, etc.
{% endhint %}

### Restoring a backup of your profile

1. From your [UNIWeb Home page](../navigating-uniweb/the-home-page.md), go to **Profile**.
2. In the right panel, click **Create/restore backups**.
3. In the right panel, click **Restore from a file**.
4. In the centre panel, click **Choose file**, and browse your computer for your backup JSON file.
5. Click **Restore**, and after the restore process is complete, click **Done**.

Clicking **Done** will return you to the main backups screen, where you will see a list of backup files that you have previously restored. Once a backup file has been uploaded, it is retained by UNIWeb so that you can revert to that backup in the future if necessary.

## Profile Sections

Your profile is divided into sections of content which are listed in the left panel for quick navigation. Certain sections may or may not be present on your profile depending on your [account type and position title](../uniweb-accounts/account-management/member-account-information.md#account-information-fields) - for instance, the Academic Supervision section is only available to members with Professor as their Account Type. 

UNIWeb includes the following sections by default, but your institution may have requested the addition of custom sections with their own Account Type associations. For information on sections that are not listed below, please contact your UNIWeb system administrator.
