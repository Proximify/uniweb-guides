# Managing Web Articles

Web articles are a great way to keep UNIWeb members updated on the latest news concerning your UNIWeb instance or your institution at large. Web articles are not categorized or restricted by academic unit. This means that as long as you have been assigned an administrator role that includes the **Edit Web Articles** permission, you can create and edit web articles that are accessible across your entire UNIWeb network, though in their [general settings](web-articles.md#article-general-settings), you can restrict their visibility to members who are logged in, or to specific UNIWeb members that you choose.

Every web article has public profile page, which includes all of its content, divided into sections, and a private profile editor, where the web article’s general settings can be modified, and sections of content can be added, edited, or removed as needed.

Each section of content can contain three \(optional\) main components:

* one **heading** for the new section
* one section of **body content** \(this can be as long as you’d like\)
* one piece of **media** - an image or video, for example - with a caption 

Because each section can only include one of each of the above components, you may need to [create a new section](web-articles.md#add-a-section) in order to continue the body text after inserting an image
