# Research Themes

Whereas [academic units](../../uniweb-accounts/academic-units/) organize UNIWeb members by the real administrative bodies that make up their institution, Research Themes serve to connect UNIWeb members across the boundaries of academic units, connecting members based on their research interests and the topics that inform their academic work. 

Every UNIWeb network comes with an extensive, pre-defined list of research themes sourced directly from the Canadian Common CV. However, as a user, you also have the option to add additional research themes. Research themes are nested. Meaning that parent interests are subsequently broken down as they get more specific. When adding a new research interest, it is important to be as specific as possible.
