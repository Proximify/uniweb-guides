# Research Themes

Research themes are one of the most important components of a UNIWeb network. Research themes are what creates the connections between members of your network. Every UNIWeb network comes with an extensive, pre-defined list of research themes sourced directly from the CCV. However, as a user, you also have the option to add additional research themes. Research themes are nested. Meaning that parent interests are subsequently broken down as they get more specific. When adding a new research interest, it is important to be as specific as possible.
