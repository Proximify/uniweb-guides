# Research Connections

Research institutions can involve vast amounts of people, all conducting research into a broad spectrum of fields of study. With so many colleagues at your institution, it's possible that another researcher in a completely different department or faculty could be researching a topic that's close to or relevant to your own, and you might never know. 

UNIWeb aims to help you break the silo walls between faculties by making it easier to find potential collaborators within your institution who are interested in the same [Research Themes](./), even if they are approaching their work from a different research perspective. 

Every time you [tag your profile with a Research Theme](increasing-discoverability-with-research-themes.md#tagging-your-public-profile-with-research-themes), UNIWeb finds other members of your UNIWeb network who have tagged their profile with the same theme, and its parents and children. UNIWeb collects and displays all of your connections on a Research Connections page that's tailored specifically for you.
