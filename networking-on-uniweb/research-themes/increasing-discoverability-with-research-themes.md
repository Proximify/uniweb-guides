## Tagging your Publications with Research Themes

You can tag one or many of your publications with a Research Theme. Once a publication has been tagged with a Research Theme, it will be displayed on your[ public profile](../your-public-profile/), and in the [Research Cluster](../research-clusters-1.md) and search results for that Research theme. 

### Adding tags to your publications

1. From your [UNIWeb Home](../../introduction/navigating-uniweb.md#the-home-page) page, go to **Publications**. 
2. **Click the checkbox** to the left of any publications that you would like to tag.
3. In the right panel, click **Add tags**.
4. In the **Tag selected publications with...** dialog, select Research Themes in the drop-down menu that you would like to tag onto your selected publications.
5. Click **Apply labels**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** You can select multiple publications at once if you would like to tag them all with the same Research Themes. You can also use the **Find and select** tool in the right panel to select multiple publications at once based on your search terms.
{% endhint %}

### Removing tags from your publications

1. From your [UNIWeb Home](../../introduction/navigating-uniweb.md#the-home-page) page, go to **Publications**. 
2. **Click the checkbox** to the left of any publications from which you would like to remove particular tags.
3. In the right panel, click **Remove tags**.
4. In the **Remove tags from selected publications** dialog, click the checkbox next to the tags that you would like to remove from your selected publications. Tags are listed in alphabetical order regardless of the selected publication - selecting a particular tag will remove it from any selected publication where it has previously been applied.
5. Click **Remove labels**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note:** Removing Research Theme tags from publications will immediately remove them from the search results and [Research Clusters](../research-clusters-1.md) that correspond to those Research Themes. Publications will remain listed on your [public profile](../your-public-profile/) as long as they are still tagged with at least one Research Theme.
