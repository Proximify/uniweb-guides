# Managing Research Themes

If you cannot find a particular Research Theme within your institution’s listings, you can propose it to your institution's UNIWeb administration team. The new Research Theme will be made available to you and your institution at large after it has been approved by an administrator.

## Creating new Research Themes

![](../../.gitbook/assets/creating-a-research-interest%20%281%29.gif)

1. From your [UNIWeb Home](../../navigating-uniweb/the-home-page.md) page, go to **Profile**. 
2. In the centre panel, navigate to the **Research Interests** section, and click **Edit**.
3. Browse and/or search through the dropdown lists of Research Themes on the left side of the centre panel. Identify the most relevant parent Research Theme for the theme that you would like to add. Ensure that the parent Research Theme is expanded to display any of its existing child themes.
4. Rest your cursor on the parent Research Theme that you have chosen, and click on the **pen icon** that appears to the right of it.
5. In the _Edit research theme_ dialog, type the name of the new child theme that you would like to create.
6. **Optional:** if necessary, click the **multilingual** toggle next to the text box to add your new theme in a second language. 
7. Click **Save** 

Any new Research Themes that you add must be approved by a UNIWeb member who has been assigned an administrator role. Completing the steps above will send a notification to administrators for approval. The new Research Theme will be displayed on your profile after it has been approved.

## Approving Research Themes

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** this procedure requires an [administrator role](../../uniweb-accounts/access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md) in any academic unit that includes the following permissions:

* Approve new themes

If you have not been assigned a Role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task, please contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

1. From your [UNIWeb Administration](../../navigating-uniweb/the-administration-page.md) page, go to **Themes**. 
2. In the right panel, under the Status heading, click **Pending**. This will filter the list of themes in the centre panel to show only themes that are pending approval.
3. Click on a theme name in the centre panel. This will open a details screen for the proposed theme, including any child themes that were created with it.
4. In the theme details screen, click Approve. You may also edit or delete the proposed theme.

On the Research Themes page, you will see a list of themes proposed by your users. Each entry includes a breakdown of the theme’s parent, any children created along with it, as well as the individual who proposed it and on what date. As an administrator, you have the ability to approve, edit or delete a theme. To do this, choose the Review option \(see ➁ in Figure 8\). From this window you can edit the nesting of the new theme, the theme name and provide a French translation \(see Figure 9\). Then you can select to approve the theme. Once you approve a theme, your name will appear next to the entry. Tip: Use the filters on the right-hand menu to easily navigate among the various themes \(see ➂ in Figure 6\).

## Editing Research Themes

Once a Research Theme has been created, you can edit its name in English or French, and you can change its parent theme.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before you begin:** this procedure requires an [administrator role](../../uniweb-accounts/access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md) with the following permissions:

* Approve new themes

If you have not been assigned a Role with the permissions listed above, and believe that you should be able to perform this task, please contact your system administrator.
{% endhint %}

1. From your [UNIWeb Administration](../../navigating-uniweb/the-administration-page.md) page, go to **Themes**. 
2. Click on a theme name in the centre panel. This will open a details screen for the proposed theme, including any child themes that were created with it.
3. In the theme details screen, edit the theme information as needed.
4. Click **Save**, or **Approve**, if the theme has not yet been approved.

## Deleting Research Themes

Over time, certain Research Rhemes may no longer be necessary, or may become redundant with the addition and growth of other Research Themes around it. 

Because Research Themes can be [tagged](increasing-discoverability-with-research-themes.md) and referenced in so many different areas of UNIWeb, deleting a Research Theme outright could negatively impact the discoverability of certain resources. To counteract this, UNIWeb allows you to delete a Research Theme by **merging it with its parent theme**. Anything that has been tagged with the deleted research theme will automatically be tagged with its parent theme instead, and **the deleted theme's children will continue to exist** as children of the deleted theme's parent without otherwise disrupting the heirarchy of themes.
