# Groups

Whether you're a part of a small study group or a large research team that spans multiple academic units, you can keep a presence for your group and keep members up to date with UNIWeb's Groups. 

Groups are profiles where you can manage multiple members and add links to pertinent files, resources, and external websites. You can also list the [Research Places](research-places-1.md) where your Group operates and [tag your Group with Research Themes](research-themes/increasing-discoverability-with-research-themes.md#tagging-groups-with-research-themes) to help boost your Group's presence on the UNIWeb network.

You don't need to be a UNIWeb administrator to start a Group - you can create and manage as many Groups as you would like with a regular UNIWeb account. If you created a Group, you are listed as its _**owner**_, and you can enlist the help of other UNIWeb members as group administrators, who can update and edit group information along with you.
