Using Academic Metrics

The academic metrics section of UNIWeb is where the raw statistical data from the network is collected and translated into meaningful information. As members of the network compose their academic CVs, data from ten categories including publications, teaching activities and funding history are also compiled here. Information on the performance of academic units or specific groups is gathered from the information added in individual UNIWeb accounts by researchers or staff.
These categories can be used to monitor the achievements and engagement of an institution or faculty over time or can be exported for formal use in a report.
