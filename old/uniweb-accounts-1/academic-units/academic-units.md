# Academic Units

In UNIWeb, academic units exist in a hierarchy and define the structure of the network. This hierarchy begins with the institution and breaks down into the academic units and sub-units. Academic units have a **name**, a **unit type** and a **parental unit**. See the following example:

**Name:** Visual Arts **Unit Type:** Department **Parental Unit:** Faculty of Arts

The Academic Units list, like many Administration pages, has helpful search and filtering options at the top of the page. If you begin typing a unit name, UNIWebâ€™s search will narrow down your list of options.
