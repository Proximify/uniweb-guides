# Downloading CVs and Reports

Using UNIWeb, you can easily generate fully-formatted academic documents using the information in your [UNIWeb Curriculum Vitae](../your-uniweb-curriculum-vitae-cv.md). While UNIWeb includes document templates such as a generic CV and an annual activity report, your institution may offer [custom templates](../../customizing-data-entry-and-reports-in-uniweb.md) for documents that reflect your department or facultyâ€™s content and formatting requirements.
