## Adding publications manually

1. From your UNIWeb Home page, go to **Publications.**
2. Locate the section for the type of publication that you would like to add. You can **click on a section listed in the left panel** to navigate directly to that section.
3. In the centre panel, click the **Add** button to the right of the section title to add a new record, or click the **Edit** button to the right of an existing record to modify it.
4. Add or edit information in the data entry form as needed.
5. Click **Save**.

**Note:Because the information that you enter will likely be used to create an exported report, or will be included in a future funding application, it’s best to be as thorough as possible as you create new records to avoid having to fill in the blanks later.**

#### **Tip:** if you’re trying to find a particular publication record to edit, you can search for it using **Command+F** in your web browser while on the Publications page. Your publications are all displayed on a single page, and so all of your records are searchable at once.

## Importing publications

UNIWeb can import publications from using XML files from EndNote, BibTex, and Google Scholar, and by using PubMed’s PMIDs.

#### **Tip:** UNIWeb automatically detects and disregards duplicates, and so you don’t need to worry about sorting new and already-imported publications yourself.

1. From your UNIWeb Home page, go to **Publications**.
2. Click **Import Publications** in the right panel.
3. Select the source of the publications you would like to import: BibTeX, Google Scholar, EndNote, or PubMed, and click **Next**.
4. If you are importing publications from BibTeX, Google Scholar, or EndNote, click **Choose File** and locate the relevant file in your computer. 
5. If you are importing publications from PubMed, type the **PubMed Identifiers** of the articles you would like to import into the text box.
6. **Optional:** if you are importing publications from BibTeX, Google Scholar, or EndNote, select **Check Author** if you would like UNIWeb to import only the publications for which you are credited as the author or editor.
7. Click **Load**.

## Deleting publications

1. From your UNIWeb Home page, go to **Publications.**
2. Locate the publication record that you would like to delete, and click the **Edit** button to the right of the record.
3. At the bottom right of the data entry form, click **Delete**.

#### **Tip:** if you’re trying to find a particular publication to delete, you can search for it using **Command+F** in your web browser while on the Publications page. Your publications are all displayed on a single page, and so all of your records are searchable at once.
