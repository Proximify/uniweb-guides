# Publications

Through various sources such as journal articles, books, book chapters, dissertations, and newspaper and magazine articles, your publications make up the bulk of the contributions listed on your academic CV. 

UNIWeb offers streamlined data entry forms to create records of your publications as per Canadian Common CV standards, but you can also import records of your publications directly from various sources that may already have them listed, such as PubMed, EndNote, BibTex, and Google Scholar.

## Adding publications manually

1. From your UNIWeb Home page, go to **Publications.**
2. Locate the section for the type of publication that you would like to add. You can **click on a section listed in the left panel** to navigate directly to that section.
3. In the centre panel, click the **Add** button to the right of the section title to add a new record, or click the **Edit** button to the right of an existing record to modify it.
4. Add or edit information in the data entry form as needed.
5. Click **Save**.

**Best practice:** Because the information that you enter will likely be used to create an exported report, or will be included in a future funding application, it’s best to be as thorough as possible as you create new records to avoid having to fill in the blanks later.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** if you’re trying to find a particular record to edit, you can search for it by pressing **Command+F \(Mac\)** or **CTRL+F \(Windows\)** in your web browser while on the Publications page. Your publications are displayed on a single page, and so all of your publications are searchable at once.
{% endhint %}

## Importing publications

UNIWeb can import publications from using XML files from EndNote, BibTex, and Google Scholar, and by using PubMed’s PMIDs.

**Tip:** UNIWeb automatically detects and disregards duplicates, and so you don’t need to worry about tracking which publications you have already imported.

5. If you are importing publications from PubMed, type the **PubMed Identifiers** of the articles you would like to import into the text box.

## Finding and removing duplicate publications

UNIWeb has built-in duplicate detection features that will identify duplicates as you import new records from various sources, but it's still possible for duplicates to occur from time to time, either by inadvertently adding a duplicate record manually, or in the event that two records of the same publication from different sources might be _just_ different enough to bypass UNIWeb's duplicate detection on import. 

For these scenarios, UNIWeb includes an advanced duplicate detection feature that you can run even when you're not importing new information. This feature can scan your publications to identify duplicates across multiple parameters, ensuring that even if some parts of the duplicate records are slightly different, they can still be identified by other markers.

### Scanning for duplicate publications

1. From your [UNIWeb Home](../navigating-uniweb/#the-home-page) page, go to **Publications.**
2. In the right panel, click **Identify Duplicates**.
3. In the **Find Duplicates** dialog, **select the parameters** that you would like UNIWeb to use to identify duplicate entries.
4. Click **Find**.

In the Duplicate detection results dialog, UNIWeb will organize duplicate entries together to easily idenitfy which elements are common between them.

### Deleting duplicate publications

1. After completing the procedure above, in the **Duplicate detection results** dialog, **click the checkbox** next to any duplicates that you would like to delete.
2. Click **Delete selected**.

### Duplicate detection parameters

| Parameter | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **With same title** | Look for duplicates that **have matching titles** \(this cannot be deselected\). |
| **In same section** | Mark records with matching titles as duplicates **only when they are both listed within the same section** - newspaper articles, book reviews, or reports, for instance. |
| **With same year** | Mark records with matching titles as duplicates **only when they are listed as having been published in the same year.** |
| **With same month** | Mark records with matching titles as duplicates **only when they are listed as having been published in the same month.** |
