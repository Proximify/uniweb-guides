# Your Public Profile

While your Curriculum Vitae is private and cannot be viewed by other UNIWeb members or visitors without delegate access, your UNIWeb account also includes a Public Profile where you can curate your CV and contact information, list your research interests, display external links and resources, and showcase your achievements within your institution. 

Through the information listed within membersâ€™ public profiles, UNIWeb offers innovative tools help you explore and discover potential collaborators throughout your institution based on research themes and connections. Accordingly, an up-to-date public profile is key to creating an active presence and meaningful connections on UNIWeb.
