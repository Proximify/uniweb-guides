# Access Control

The Access Control section of UNIWeb consists of two components: Roles and Member Access. A role is a set of permissions assigned to a particular type of user, please see the following example.
The member access section is where you assign these roles to users of your network.
When your institution sets up their network, the Proximify team will create your first administrator accounts. As an administrator, it is your responsibility to assign roles to future users.

### In this section:
- Managing Administrator Roles and Permissions
- Managing Administrators
- Delegate Access
