# Customizing data entry and reports in UNIWeb

UNIWeb comes with generic annual report and CV template that has options that can be set at download, your academic unit or institution may want to offer more options to users. Duplicate your existing report guidelines in UNIWeb, or design an entirely new report to take advantage of the existing report guidelines in UNIWeb, or design an entirely new report to take advantage of the advanced calculations and data presentation that UNIWeb Reports can perform.

## Customizing UNIWeb’s data entry forms

By default, UNIWeb’s data entry forms are matched with those of the Canadian Common CV, but the data fields in UNIWeb can be expanded to collect data beyond what is required by the CCV if needed.

**Note:** Adding new data fields or sections does not affect the interactions between UNIWeb and the CCV. Accordingly, CCV-standard data entry fields cannot be removed from UNIWeb, or reordered or otherwise modified.

## Creating custom report templates

Custom reports are documents that present information from Members’ UNIWeb CV according to the needs of a particular institution or department. Institutions often use UNIWeb’s report templates for annual activity reporting purposes.

While UNIWeb includes a generic annual activity report template, institutions may contact Proximify to have new report templates created based on their own brand guidelines, specifications, and requirements.

**The design of a report template includes at minimum three things:**

* The **layout and styling** of the report. An existing sample document is the easiest way to present how you want the document to look.
* A **mapping**  document that indicates which UNIWeb CV fields should be used to populate the report with information, and where the information should be presented in the report. Data in the report can be arranged in any order—it is not constrained by where it appears in the UNIWeb CV.
* Any **formulas** that should be applied to the data. The most common examples of this are lifetime summaries, such as of funding, publications, or students graduated. UNIWeb Report takes the raw data and can perform the necessary calculations in order to make the data meaningful to reviewers.

For more information on the report design and creation process, download our **Report Design** document, and contact us at **requests@proximify.ca.**

## Creating custom input templates

You can have custom input templates created for your UNIWeb instance to help UNIWeb members update their CVs and fill out reports. These templates can be assigned to an academic unit to allow researchers in that unit to input CV data without being shown other custom data entry fields that are not relevant to their work, or the template can be designed to assist with the data entry of a specific internal report.
