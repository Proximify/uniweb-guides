# La page des membres

## The Members Page

The Members page is a **full, publicly-accessible list of the members of your UNIWeb network**. Members can be filtered by academic unit in the left panel, and by academic title on the right. Clicking on a member will lead to their [public profile](../networking-on-uniweb/filling-out-your-public-profile.md).
