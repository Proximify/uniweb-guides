# La page d'administrateurs

The Administration Page is a dashboard combining specialized sections where UNIWeb administrators can perform various administrative tasks. 

**You can access the Administration Page by clicking Administration in UNIWeb's top navigation bar.** The Administration Page will only be available to you if you have been assigned an administrator role.

The Administration Page has eight main sections, as listed below. You will only see the sections that correspond to the permissions that you have been granted through the [administrator roles](../uniweb-accounts/access-control/managing-administrator-roles-and-permissions.md) that were assigned to you.

## API Access

The API Access section allows you to manage your UNIWeb instance's custom integrations with third-party services.

## Data and Report Templates

The Data Reports and Templates section allows you to **view the sets of mapping rules, called** _**schemas**_**, that generate UNIWeb's data entry forms and tell UNIWeb how to generate CV and report documents**. Generally, if a UNIWeb user indicates that their CV or report document is missing a record, cross-referencing that report's schema will help you identify why that record was not included in the exported file.
